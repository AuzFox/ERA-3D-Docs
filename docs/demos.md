## Installing Demos

The demo files can be placed anywhere, but it is recommended to put them in ERA-3D's `carts` directory:

=== "Windows"

	```
	C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\era-3d\carts
	```

=== "Linux"

	```
	~/.era-3d/carts
	```

## Running Demos

In ERA-3D, press ++ctrl+o++ to open the Load Cart dialog, which should by default open to the ERA-3D `carts` directory.

Highlight the demo file using ++up++/++down++ and press ++enter++ to load it.

Once the demo is loaded, run the cart by pressing ++ctrl+r++.
